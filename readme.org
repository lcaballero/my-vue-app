* Introduction

=my-vue-app= is a truly bare-bones example of [[https://webpack.github.io/][webpack]] and [[http://vuejs.org/][vuejs]].  It
should run after initial setup.

** Prerequisites

=node.js= and =npm= must be installed.  I find it useful to have
=./node_modules/.bin= on the path.  The advantages: don't require
further dependencies be installed that are already in =package.json=
and usage of =webpack= need not be installed globally.  The whole
directory becomes very portable as a result.

** Setup

These commands install the node module dependencies and transpile
assets.  =-w= causes webpack to watch the file structure and
re-transpiles assets that have changed.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
npm install
webpack -w
#+END_SRC

Then in another terminal start the webserver.  As development
progresses the process running webpack will rebuild assets, and the
process below will serve up those assets.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
webpack-dev-server --inline
#+END_SRC

** Client Assets

**** *index.html*
Take note of the element shown as:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<div id="app">
  <app></app>
</div>
#+END_SRC

This is the root mount point for the vue.js application.  It contains
an app component.  The div and ID are specified to provide the
main.es6 a location to bind the starting point.

**** *src/app.vue*
app.vue is a component combine by web pack and provided to JS code via
require(..) calls.  The component by convention is the =app= element.

**** *src/main.es6*
The main file which initializes the page.  It references the div
containing the element.  It imports Vue and bootstraps it and loads
the App component and integrates it.

** Development Files

**** *package.json*
Minimal amount of dependencies to get this application transpiled and
served. 

**** *.babelrc*
Required to transpile es6.

**** *.gitignore*
Of note, this file contains the line =dist/= which will ignore
generated assets so that they don't get commited to the repository.
Which means webpack must be ran before the app is useable.

**** *webpack.config.js*
Contains a minimal config for webpack with additional locations to
lookup importable JS code/components.  For instance, becuase of the
resolve values Vue and be imported like so: =require('vue.js').
